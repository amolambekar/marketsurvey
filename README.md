Goal:
Develop the back-end of an application similar to SurveyMonkey - intended for simple polls comprising a question with multiple choice answers – preferably following the micro-services architecture pattern. Nothing too complicated, but just keep in mind the following features:

•	Add/edit/delete question & answers
•	Read a list of all questions
•	Read a question with all answers
•	Respond to a survey
•	Read the result for a particular question showing the total number of responses and distribution among the possible answers in %.

The solution uses Spring Data Rest to to expose JPA repositories as REST API.

#TODO

1. Complete tests for responding to a survey and finding results for a particular questions with total responses in %
